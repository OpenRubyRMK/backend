= OpenRubyRMK backend

The OpenRubyRMKâ€™s backend library, i.e. the component that does the
heavy lifting of all the data and which is utilised by GUI
frontends. Ideally, it will sometime find its way into
Karfunkel[http://devel.pegasus-alpha.eu/projects/openrubyrmk-karfunkel],
the hypothetic OpenRubyRMK server that will one day make the
OpenRubyRMK a network application.

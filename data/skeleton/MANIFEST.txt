What is this?
=============

The config/skeleton subdirectory of Karfunkel’s directory tree
contains the default layout that will be applied to a newly created
project, with some small modifications taken out automatically. If
you aren’t content with the defaults the ORR team provides Karfunkel
with, feel free to customise this directory to your needs, just keep
existing things where they are.

This MANIFEST.txt file contains a short description of the
already existing subdirectories (see below).

Files and directories and their meaning
=======================================

This file is a brief summary of how OpenRubyRMK project directories
are organised. First note, that the project directory contains your
project as Karfunkel, the server, sees it. The actual layout of a game
you distribute may look entirely different.

Structure is as follows:

Path                    Description
-----------------------------------
/                       Project root directory.
  - MANIFEST.txt        This file.
  bin/                  Contains the main file.
    - name_of_proj.rmk  Project main file, containg name, version, etc.
  data/                 Project data. Graphics, music, ...
    - categories.xml    Categories (items, skills, etc.) used in a project.
    audio/              Sounds and music.
    graphics/           Characters, tilesets...
    maps/               Actual maps.
      - maps.xml        Map hierarchy file, specifies which maps are submaps of other maps.
    scripts/            Global scripts loaded prior to game start. These are those you can create via the "normal" GUI, don’t confuse with the game core library in lib/!
  lib/                  Game core library, i.e. battle and map handling code, etc. These can be edited from the advanced GUI with the Script Editor.
